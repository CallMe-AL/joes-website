Jet arrived at the northern entrance of Echo’s megaplex around twenty minutes later, NAS in tow. She’d built up a good sweat, evident by the crinkled noses of teens she pushed past entering the lobby. She shoved her way inside an almost full elevator; the doors stuck twice but managed to shut all the way on the third try. She rode it all eighty-seven stories while the speaker system embedded overhead played advertisements for penis replacement surgery and vaginal synth-lube, promising better sex that would “_break the bed, not the bank_”.

Jet approached Echo’s apartment; the intercom recognized a private key stored on her deck-drive and opened the door automatically. She forced the NAS through Echo’s narrow door frame, into her one-hundred square foot apartment, and set it on the floor with a _thud_.

A toilet, a sink, and a countertop-covered dishwasher spanned the opposite wall in front of her. A tight, tiled shower sunk into the back corner, next to the toilet; a mini-fridge sat on the floor, plugged into the near wall; a dirty mattress lay discarded, out of the way. The rest was screenspace, focused around a desk and a thin fiber-optic cable protruding from the far wall, connected to Echo’s gateway, terminating ultimately to her console.

“Took ya long enough,” she quipped from her _ChairMaster_™, swiveling around to meet Jet in the middle of the room.

“Shit’s heavy. How ‘bout you play datarunner next time the cops ‘cideta crash?”

“Can’t believe that geeze was blue… well I can, but I mean... what the fuck? The fuck’s he even doing at Sheng’s anyway?”

“_Good_ question,” Jet responded, pondering. “Sheng wouldn’t leak, right? Can’t picture him in bed with blues but I guess I never really knew his biz ‘cept what I’d buy.”

Echo looked down at a burn hole in the peeling linoleum floor, “Guess you really didn’t know him all that well then, huh…” she chuckled softly to herself and looked back at Jet, meeting her gaze, “Y’know he really only copped that shit for you, right?”

“Wait what? Then why was policeman iced on the couch, higher than a fuckin’ drone?”

“Couldn’t tell ya, maybe I didn’t know him all that well neither…” She paused. “But Sheng always left a port open for you, Jet. Since I introduced you two.”

Jet burst out laughing, “No shit?” Where could he’ve gotten the idea that she might be interested? And that Echo of all people introduced them.

“I’m serious, dude wanted you _hard_ for what, _six years_?”

“Six years?” Jet thought aloud, “Damn, close enough I guess...” Somehow it seemed like six years was simultaneously longer and shorter than they had known each other. Time moved differently in the back half of her twenties; she wasn’t a kid anymore. Jet studied Echo’s face, took in the soft apples of her cheeks, the gentle creases that just kissed the corners of her lips - _neither was she_.

“All that time ain’t never even logged a request, huh?” They both looked down for a second, “Musta figured he had time…”

“Yea…” Jet exhaled, “musta…” She looked up at Echo with a smirk and they met eyes again, “How much time you think _we_ got?”

“Thought you said we’re livin’ forever, remember?”

Jet laughed again, a little more freely, “Yea, now that you mention it, I did say that didn’t I? ” She took a step closer and placed her knee on the seat of Echo’s _ChairMaster_™, between her thighs, maintaining eye contact until Echo looked away. Her hair fell over the right side of her face; Jet brushed it back gently and let her hand linger.

“Jet…” Echo grabbed her lingering hand, held it for a moment, then pushed her away. “No… We’ve tried this before...” She looked down again, then back up with a playful smile, “Plus, you smell like shit.”

“I know Ech, but _c’mon_… ” she bit her lip and moved in, speaking softly in Echo’s ear as her other hand reached lower, “Bet we both could liquid-cool right now…” She put her hand on Echo’s crotch, felt its warmth for a microsecond before her body recoiled at the touch. She slapped Jet’s hand away, stinging her with the back of a steel ring.

“Goddammit, Jet, I said no! _Biàntài!_ Always firewalled off but never ‘fraid to finger someone else’s port, _huh_?”

“Jesus, Echo, slow down--”

“No, Jet, I’m serious, we’ve traced this route before! And Sheng’s dead… Jesus...” She paused again. “Y’know what? Maybe you should just get the fuck out of here, head back to your rig, and boot up one of those scripts you spend so much time on. That’ll call your function, _I’m sure_.”

Jet shot back, “Wow, Ech, good one, haven’t heard it before! _You_ know what?” She stood up and walked backwards towards the door, “Maybe if you got _any_ traffic at all, you wouldn’t be such an uptight bitch.” She squinted her eyes, making a face, “It’d do ya good.”

“Fuck you. Go take a cold shower.”

“Yea?” Jet cleared her throat, “_Ahem_, how ‘bout you send this shit to my console,” she kicked the NAS, still on the floor, denting its chassis, “then feel free to fuck _right_ off.” Two fingers took flight, the door flicked open, Jet stepped back, and the door _-_­_shhhk_- closed shut.

From her apartment, Echo was just able to parse the stream of obscenities Jet shouted aloud, mostly muted, as she stomped down the hall. Her eyes returned to the burn hole, glazed. She cried.
