Jet stood alone in the alleyway, dirty rainwater swirling at her feet. She watched a greasy oil-slick of grime and sludge wash from cement and pavement, pool around her scuffed _Doc Martens_ and gurgle down the nearly busted storm drain beneath her. The hum of flickering neon signage droned persistently above, punctuated by droplets of precipitation. She hadn't been high in a week, five days to be exact.

_Thump! Thump! Thump!_ "Yo, Yisheng! You home, right?"

No answer.

_Thump! Thump! Thump!_ She tried the intercom again, "_She-eng,_ I know you're fuckin' in there. You duckin' me?" Her deck converted each word to text as she spoke; haptic feedback buzzed gently behind her forehead, notification of successful senditure.

Still no answer.

_Alright, time's up._

_Bzzt,_ another buzz in her sinuses; a new message popped into the notification tray of her HUD, a header reading "From: Echo" in plain red text. She selected it, "How was your night?"

"I'll let you know when it's over", _bzzt,_ she replied with a heel-kick that landed just left of Sheng's door knob. The force of Jet's foot busted the frame and sent the door crashing against his apartment wall. Sheng was the only op she knew with a legacy install like this, and destroying it brought a fast smile to her face. _Who the fuck used wood anymore anyway? Who could even find it?_ Well, if anyone, it'd be Sheng.

They'd been plugged-in for years and he'd find anything, no matter the ask. Screamers, dozers, tank-glass, dry herb, he even scored an alpha version of some biosoft once that made her deck woozy. It'd been a milly since their last connect though, maybe since _her_ last score? Shit, had it really been that long?

Her latest defrag lasted months and she wasn't proud of it. They were usually more costly than she cared to admit, but at least this time she went in with a plan. Strictly vapor, a mix of lisdexamfetamine, nicotine, and THC; there was no afterburn and her deck stayed clean. She wrote some killer script and flipped it fast, actually made enough to finally upgrade to _Centauri_. Not that Sheng would care, he'd never even been chipped. Said he never would be neither.

She stepped into Sheng's apartment slowly. It was dark and smelled of iron and incense. A narrow hallway stretched a few feet in front of her, coat hooks hung haphazardly on the drywall. One held Sheng's favorite jacket, a blue bomber with an embroidered red horse. Another held a dull gray long-coat still damp with rainwater. Jet reached for her piece, a limited edition _Sengoku Samurai_ adorned with pinkish-white _Hello Kitty_ decals.

Dim light flickered at the far end of the hall while Jet eased her way inside, passing a dingy kitchen littered with takeout boxes and empty two liter pop bottles. Her steel-toes stayed silent against the hardwood as the lights danced across the far wall, buzzing with faint electricity. She reached the wide archway that led to the living room and pressed her back to the near wall, peeked the corner and almost spewed at the massacre that entered her orbital relays.

In the corner of the room, Yisheng lay in blood and viscera, half-dangled off his rig's cockpit, head nearly blown to bits. The lights from his console and six _Samsung Super_ OLEDs shone behind his body, casting a grim shadow along the ceiling. Two upper screens were shattered, the rest, coated in type AB. The smell of iron was pungent now, but the sweetness of nearly burnt-out incense stuck to the back of Jet's throat. She struggled to stifle a cough at the sight of a large figure slumped in Sheng's sofa, not five feet from his corpse.

"SHIT'S FUCKED AT SHENG'S" _bzzt_

_*notifications off*_

She peeked the corner again, getting a better look at the hulking mass on the couch. An enormous man straining a collared button-down, eyes to the skies, totally iced. One of his sleeves was rolled-up over the elbow exposing track marks and old ink; his ocular lenses sparked with data. An equally impressive handgun rested on the coffee table in front of him, the long, suppressed barrel pointed in Jet's direction. She turned the corner and drew, a slight tremble in her grip. Her _Samurai_ was a ballistic model with a simple processor capable of providing real time ammo-count via encrypted RFID. She squeezed the trigger and reduced the count by one, putting a round through the man's femur.

"Who _the fuck_ are you!?" Jet screamed. The man defrosted near instantaneously with a terrible, shrieking yell. "And why _the fuck_ is Sheng dead!?" She stood unblinking, unwavering, watching the man's pupils re-emerge through fading data streams. His somatosensory inhibitor functions aborted at the forced disconnect; surprise turned to pain turned to rage; his eyes darted to the coffee table.

"I wouldn't!" Jet warned, but he made his move and she made hers, not hesitating to zero him. The digital "18" overlaid on her sensory input now read "17", just above the remnants of the man's intra-made-extra-cranial space. She wiped the splatter from her eyelids, "Fuckin' junkies, Jesus..."

_*notifications on*_

_Bzzt_ "Wym??"

_Bzzt_ "Jet, you alright!?"

_Bzzt_ "Fuck, you really turned off notifications again!??"

"Sheng's dead. Goddamn _yinjunzi_ butchered him..."

_*Call from Echo*_

_*Connected*_

"_Fuck_, Jet... I'm sorry."

"Don't be, you knew him better anyway... Want my feed-hyper so you can get eyes on this?"

A moment passed before Echo responded, "Sure, ship it."

"Alright port's open," Jet's eyes flashed, "sending now."

Twenty-three blocks away and eighty-seven stories above, Echo received the hyperlink. She took a breath and followed it, her console exchanging ciphers with Jet's deck, shaking hands, and displaying the raw optical feed directly to her fifty-four-inch _Sony Sugoi_ in full 56K. She jacked her own orbital relays into the _Sugoi_ and let Jet's feed buffer, "Shiiit... you ain't even nano-hesitate 'fore zeroin' him, huh?"

Jet didn't answer, looking up instead at the blood splatters which decorated the ceiling. She followed them with her eyes, down the walls and screen arrays to Yisheng's desecrated rig. His mangled face was enough to elicit a gasp from Echo, his gray matter, a tear. Before she could speak, a daemon toasted her screen, "ID Confirmed". She selected the alert,

identity.unknown0.tattooForearm FOUND IN nygap.bodyMarker

SELECT * :

"Fuckin' kidding me, Jet, _junzi_'s blue."

"You glitched?"

"Sum's checked; you gotta post 'fore NYGAP scrambles."

Average emergency response time to new-coast districts varied from an hour to a business day, but Echo was right. Jet had no doubt cop-man's biomon triggered a rapid response alert the moment his vitals disconn'd; she'd be swarmed with Neo-Yor Gong Armed Police any minute.

"Something we gotta do first; you see this too?" Jet's eyes darted to Sheng's _Super_ OLEDs. Echo made a sound in confirmation. Disregarding the two shattered screens, the six which remained appeared to function through bloody red film. What was more, miraculously, Sheng's rig was unlocked. All three were chairjocks; all three of them developed the same early-age impulse to lock their machine and protect their data, yet here Sheng's sat, accessible. Jet opened a terminal.

"I'm pulling back everything I can touch, should only take a minute on Sheng's network. I'd like a bare-metal too, while we're here. Wanna handle that on your end?"

"Uh... not really, Jet... situation's all sorts of fucked...", the line stayed silent for some seconds, "But yea... sure, crack a port and I'll connect." Jet quickly opened a listening port from Sheng's machine, configuring it to forward traffic to the secure shell service she was interfacing with via _Deck-Connect_. The local-net was thru-putting at around four-hundred gigabits per second; Jet's file transfer finished up in around forty-five.

Her deck flipped bits as she rummaged through two desk drawers, the bottom of which contained various pill bottles prescribed to fake IDs. She grabbed a lisdex script, opened it, and crushed a single pill on the desktop, then snorted the pile whole. The rush started from the top of her head; the room came into focus and time lagged IRL. Just then something flashed on Echo's HUD.

"Ayo, can I get an ETA on file transfer?"

"Forty-five flat over Sheng-net," Jet checked the drawer again; only two more bottles. She unzipped the right pocket of her black _JùdÀmerican MicroMesh_™ jacket and stuffed them inside_, "_shouldn't differ much remotely, minus generating the bak."

"Console's saying more like twenty minutes... FS lookin' like half a peta? That compile?"

"Half a peta?" Jet looked incredulous, "Nah Ech, seg fault; where you seeing this?"

"Like I said, Jet, just what the filesystem's tellin' me. Gotta be some dark-drives on mount or something; you see a NAS around?"

Jet scanned the room and saw nothing immediately out of place, save the headless dash-nines and their bodily fluids sprayed throughout the room. She switched her relay-feed's output from visual-band to infrared. "_Jiaohua de Yisheng_", she said aloud, staring at a geometric cube of heat-source beneath the coffee table of his studio living room.

She made her way over to the table and flipped it, a haggard rug lay directly above the heat-source; pulling it aside only greeted her with more hardwood. She dropped to her knees to investigate, worked her fingers along the plank-seams until eventually being rewarded with a few tip-sized grooves, easily slotting her slender digits. Jet pulled back each plank, one by one, 'til the network attached storage device revealed itself, snug inside a waterproof chassis, "Good call, Echo, founda NAS. I'm takin' it and gettin' the fuck out."
