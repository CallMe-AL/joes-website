Jet bouldered her way back inside the elevator, nearly knocking over an elderly woman who smelled like jasmine and cursed loudly in Fuzhounese. She sought her best revenge, planting the flat foot of her walking cane squarely on Jet’s big toe, only to be thwarted by rugged leather and hard steel. Steely too were Jet’s eyes, daring her to try again. The woman thought better of it, deciding to play it off as an accident instead, and quietly minded her own business. Jet punched the button for the fiftieth floor.

_*notifications off*_

_Who the hell does Echo think she is?_ Jet thought, _Where the fuck does she get off? Oh wait!_ Her scowl subsided momentarily, internal laughter at her own joke. Her foot reflexively tapped an exact sub-conscious match of the rhythmic bed-squeaks emanating from the same gen-mod ad played overhead at full volume: _squeak! – squeak! – squeak!_

_I don’t need her,_ the elevator stopped and a few people entered and exited. An important looking businessman with slicked-back hair slithered his way inside, smelling of cigarettes. Jet felt a sudden tug at the front of her head begging for nicotine, _and_ _she sure as shit don’t need me. Fuck I could use a smoke right now…_ She eyed businessman up and down; he paid her no mind, looking blankly at the wall in front of him. The corrugated steel reflected soft shimmers of pale-gold light flickering delicately from his electric eyes.

Jet reached around the pocket of her _JùdÀmerican_ jacket and pulled out a lisdex script, practically prying apart the child-proof pill bottle. Her clenched fist crushed an active dose to dust, her right nostril greedily accepted the humble offering. The old woman, now sandwiched between Jet and businessman, muffled a murmur of malcontent. She shuffled in protest, knocked businessman from his trance, and caught an elbow in the ribs for her trouble: _Huang lian puo!_

The elevator reached the fiftieth just as Jet’s head hit the stratosphere. Its lurching stop pulled her stomach through the floor and the rest of her body back to Earth. The _ding-_ing double doors collapsed into the cabin, immediately penetrated by fifty-thousand gleaming watts of punishing purple signage:

_F L O O R - 5 0_

_五十层_

The sign shone from a once-silver pillar sat seventy feet or so away from the elevator’s entrance. Jet exited and walked onto one of only two shopping centers in all of _Buckingham Megaplex Seventee_n; _Floor Fifty_, as its denizens would tell you, was a thing of its very own. Five full stories of shop-til-you-drop fever and family fun ‘round every corner; Jet decided to hit her favorite brothel first.

_Angelica’s_ had been around since Echo moved to district four, and a milly or two before that. A genuine establishment by any measure, the sparsely decorated entrance sat nestled between a _Han Noodle_ _Bar_ and a rickety _PC bang,_ illuminated and demarcated by a ten-foot-tall pink neon “A” adorned with blue wings and matching halo. The careful consumer could count on a money back guarantee, though few passed through who couldn’t be satisfied one way or another; for most, there were many.

A few others also made their way off the elevator, squinting to accommodate the new light levels. Jet’s orbital relays immediately sensed and responded to the change, adjusting her apertures automatically. She looked at the hustle and bustle; people filled every nook, every niche, every square inch of the elevators, escalators, walkways, hallways, tunnels, bridges, and lanes which wound through street stands setup on the spot and businesses built into support structures.

Advertisements abounded in any and all freespace: _Drink Coke! Drink Pepsi! Buy a new phone! Buy a new deck! Go ahead, get chipped! It’s all here! It’s all for you! It’s all wrapped in plastic, shiny and new!_

Jet followed the flow of foot-traffic, guided by the brothel’s beacon. Upon crossing the threshold that separated outside from in, a banner toasted her screen:

_Angelica Welcomes You_

The dim light caused her apertures to adjust again; her digital vision cut through the vapor clouds billowing from five velveted hookah pits. A different dancer worked the center of each, some on poles, others on platforms, none with any modesty.

Jet made her way to the back and pulled up a stool at the bar, “Ayo, _ock_, how ‘bout a packa e-cigs and a beer? Actually,” She held up two fingers in a ‘V’, “make it two.”

“Two packsa e-cigs or two beers, jackass?” the bartender turned around, a middle-aged woman with a mean look in her eye. Jet matched the mood as long as she could before cracking a smile.

“How the fuck you been, Ange?”

“Better than you I bet, ain’t seen you ‘round in a milly, Jet”

“Yea, well…” She scratched the back of her head, “Y’know how it goes.”

“Not really. Sounds like you livin’ the meme then, friend.”

“Why the fuck you think I always come back?”

“Cuz you _biàntài_ and you know it,” Angelica almost seemed to smirk, pulling a frosty bottle of _Labatt’s_ from beneath the bar, opening it with a _-tss­-_ and handing it to her with a fully-charged e-cig rig. Jet grabbed the bottle, cold to the touch, but Angelica didn’t let go. They locked eyes for a second, neither blinked, before she loosened her grip.

Jet tapped out a stick from the rig, brought it to her mouth, and took a long drag. The soft, pink LED lit up the end of her nose and the rush was exactly as she had hoped; relaxation from the back of her brain, moving forward in waves ‘til the light turned blue. She took another drag.

“See you got yourself a new girl, huh?” Jet motioned to a lithe, young boy dancing at the center of a hookah pit near the front entrance. Hairless from the neck down, he looked at least ten years her junior, seventeen at the oldest, and wore bright green go-go heels and a matching thong. His hips gyrated to an electronica beat generated on the fly by a neural-net DJ hosted on-prem. Even in the dim light, his motion revealed dull flashes of copper circuitry embedded subdermally around the eye sockets.

“Yea, pretty little thing, that one.”

“How long ‘til she pays off her warez?”

“Long.” Angelica left it at that, her fake smile now barely more than a cheap copy pasted to her face.

“I’ll take her.”

“You got the cred, sure, but somethin’ tells me you ain’t.”

“Shit, Ange, you served me.” They both laughed, “Plus I’ve been doin’ alright for myself lately.” Jet’s face almost appeared smug.

“That so, huh?”

“Well, seein’ as they don’t just give out _Centauris_,” She tapped the side of her head, “doin’ somethin’ right, right?”

“Well shit, look at the big deck on Jet.”

She chuckled and took a sip of beer, “Like you didn’t know the moment I walked in.”

“Now where would you ever get that idea from?” Angelica put a hand on her hip. “Good pimps don’t keep tabs ‘less you open one.”

“Feel free to keep bullshittin’ but I know everything, hard or soft, in this little joint.” Jet joked, looking around, gesturing broadly. Her eyes settled back on Angelica, “Including you.” Silence lingered between them.

“Very first time Echo even took me to this floor, we owned every subnet ‘fore sunrise.” She looked down at her beer, illuminated by the butt of her e-cig, then took a sip and exhaled vapor from her nose. Another near-smug smile flashed across her face, “Plus I know when I been fingered.”

“Ha, you’re cute, Jet, but you're the one talkin’ bullshit. Had that _actually_ happened, my countermeasures woulda fried your shit.”

“You mean your _‘Intrusion Counter-Electronics’_ from last fuckin’ century?” Angelica’s face approximated a nano-second of surprise, “Should really stick to stuff within this decade, babe, tech’s changing all the time. But we got biz, the new girl, remember?”

“Of course,” Angelica almost looked relieved, “I’ll send the invoice.” It appeared on Jet’s screen immediately. She tapped it, “And I’ll ship the funds.” Both women’s eyes flashed as a thousand RMBit-dollars exchanged hands, plus an extra hundred.

“_Angelica appreciates your business_,” she responded with a bow.

“Heh, and Jet ‘preciates yours,” she downed the sudsy remains of her _Labatt’s_ and had a replacement in front of her ‘fore she could even set it back down. Jet picked it up and made her way over to the front-most hookah pit to collect her prize. His creamy flesh looked smooth, soft to the touch. She took a seat and watched him move, sipping her beer, trying to make eye contact.

A few others sat around the main attraction, smoking from long, winding tubes piping fresh vapor from the central atomizer that served as a dance floor for one. Some tipped with cash, most with direct digital deposits, causing a toy lodged in the boy’s anus to vibrate, and him to blush. An LED gauge measured how many tips had accumulated; once each pip was filled, the dancer would remove the next layer of clothing. Jet intended on removing the final piece herself. She bit her lip, and finally he made eye contact.

A sharp expression sent a notification to his deck directly, authorized by the local-net, notifying him of the transaction that took place. He gave her a sheepish look back and turned his head down, slipping slightly as he stepped from the atomizer in steep heels. The crowd jeered, discontented; one booed Jet who paid them no mind. Her attention was focused solely on the coltish figure, out of the spotlight now, silhouetted against the smoke, stumbling. She left the beer and moved to help him, just in time to catch his fall.

He lay in her sturdy arms, heavier than she expected, “So that’s a fall from grace, huh?” He giggled, and Jet carried him towards a private room in the back. “You, uh, got a name?”

“People usually call me Snow”, he said, batting fake eyelashes. His eyelids shimmered slightly with metallic-flecked blue shadow; his cheeks contoured to perfect convexes with a mix of blush and liquid foundation.

“Ha, I can see why,” she replied, momentarily distracted by his nubile skin, white like analog static, “Ain’t seen many like you ‘round here.”

“Yea, I guess...” he trailed off as they reached the back of the brothel. A metal door slid open for Jet upon approach, revealing a small room with a circular double bed, an acrylic-painted chair with a simple desk, and a wardrobe. An old-world holodeck was bolted to the center of the ceiling, powered down. The only sound was the soft, vibrating hum of an air vent pumping in AC.

Now that they were alone Jet could smell his perfume, coffee with white orchids and sweet vanilla. She set the boy down and he sauntered to the bed. She grabbed at his neon green thong, tugging at him with a smirk, and he peeled it off, revealing a sizable chrome penis bulging below the waist. “I’m sending you the controls now.” His eyes flashed and a window appeared on Jet’s screen offering primary control; she accepted.

“The capabilities include, but aren’t limited to vibration, rotation, pulsation, and telescopic length,” he cycled through each option as it was mentioned and his metal member reacted in turn, ending with an impressively rigid twelve-inches.

“Thanks,” Jet said, making her way over to the wardrobe. She opened it and searched, pulling out a nearly identical piece of machinery before stripping down herself, “but we won’t need it.”

She brought the top of her selection to her mons pubis, the rest completely covered her outer labia, and six, hexagonally orientated attenuators attached the phallic device with mechanical clicks. It connected and linked to her _Centauri System_, flashing a brief warning of potential side-effects (which Jet ignored), before allowing the direct interface with her autonomic nervous system. She stroked herself, savoring the sensation, “Why don’t you start on your knees and we’ll see where this goes.”
